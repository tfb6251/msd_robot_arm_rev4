# robot_servoing

This is a simple ROS 2 package for controlling a robotic arm with a gamepad.  
Compatible with ROS 2 Humble.

## Overview

The `robot_servoing` package provides nodes and modules to facilitate servoing and basic manipulation tasks for a robot arm using ROS 2. This package is designed to be easy to use and integrate with other ROS 2 projects.

## Features

- ROS 2 compliant nodes for robot servoing.
- Basic control interfaces for a robotic arm.
- Modular code structure.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository into your ROS 2 workspace (e.g., `~/ros2_ws/src`):

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/trahnt/msd_robot_arm_2.git
   ```

2. Build the workspace:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   colcon build
   ```

## Usage

1. Source your workspace after building:

   ```bash
   source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   ```

2. Launch or run the package's nodes directly. For example:

   ```bash
   ros2 run robot_servoing <node_name>
   ```

   Replace `<node_name>` with the specific node you want to launch.
